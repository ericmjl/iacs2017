IACS Contest
============

My contest entries are present in the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.

There are two figures, one interactive and one static, and they can be found under the **"Contest Entry"** header (a `Ctrl-F` or `Cmd-F` should do). Alternatively, simply scroll to the end of the notebook.

The interactive figure requires that the entire notebook be run from scratch. The static figure is also present in the directory under the name `overview_plot.pdf`. Figure captions are inside the notebook.
